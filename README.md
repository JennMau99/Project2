# Project2

Current due date: Friday

**Number of testcases passing:** 7/16

# Things to do:
1. Rewrite part of hash_words so that it correctly processes strings. I don't know if that means using something other than strtok or not, we'll have to talk about it.
2. Change hash_words so that it can take both lines and words of variable length. Currently, two of the testcases are failing because they test that very long lines/words can be read correctly. Same as above, I don't know if that'll involve changing strtok or not.
3. Add some error messages for input. That's why testcase 1 and 2 are failing.
4. Add support for stdin.
